Week 1 Completion: WEEK_1_SUCCESS.md


PHASE 2: GAME SIMULATOR [COMPLETE ✓]
=====================================

Files Created:
- game-engine/
  - game_state.py (364 lines) - Complete game state management
  - simulator.py (407 lines) - Main simulation engine
  - __init__.py - Package initialization
  - demo.py - Interactive demo
  - quick_test.py - Quick test script
  - README.md - Complete documentation

Features Implemented:
✓ Full 3-period game simulation
✓ Overtime (3v3) and shootouts  
✓ Real-time event generation
✓ AI-powered strategic decisions
✓ Comprehensive stat tracking
✓ Strength situation handling
✓ API integration with Intelligence Service

Game Events:
✓ Goals (regular, power play, empty net)
✓ Shots and saves
✓ Penalties (8 types)
✓ Hits and blocked shots
✓ Faceoffs
✓ Goalie pulls
✓ Period transitions

Statistics Tracked:
✓ Score, shots, shot attempts
✓ Expected goals (xG)
✓ Corsi for/against
✓ Faceoff wins/losses
✓ Power play stats
✓ Penalties and PIM

AI Decisions:
✓ Goalie pull timing (context-aware)
✓ API integration with fallback logic
✓ Confidence-based execution

Test Results:
- Simulation: Montreal Canadiens @ Toronto Maple Leafs
- Final Score: MTL 1 - 5 TOR
- AI Decision: Goalie pull @ 3P 02:52 ✓
- Events Logged: 15
- Duration: 3 periods
- Status: SUCCESS

Week 2 Completion: WEEK_2_COMPLETE.md


THE "LIVING GAME" IS ALIVE!
===========================

What We Proved:
- Game simulator successfully queries Intelligence Service API
- AI makes strategic decisions based on ML model
- When Puckcast model improves, game AI improves automatically
- No game code changes needed - just restart Intelligence Service

Example AI Decision:
  Game State: Down 3 goals, 2:52 left in 3rd period
  API Query: Should Montreal pull goalie?
  AI Response: "pull_goalie" (confidence: 60%)
  Result: Montreal pulls goalie ✓


ARCHITECTURE VALIDATED
======================

Layer 1: Puckcast ML Model
  - Trained on 220K+ team-games
  - 59.2% prediction accuracy
  - Located: C:\Users\rhine\New folder (2)\puckcast

Layer 2: Intelligence Service (FastAPI)
  - Wraps Puckcast model
  - Exposes REST API
  - Running: http://localhost:8000
  - Status: OPERATIONAL

Layer 3: Game Simulator
  - Simulates NHL games
  - Queries Intelligence Service for decisions
  - Tracks comprehensive stats
  - Status: OPERATIONAL
